# FRCRAC with FEM Visualisation

This repository hosts a Streamlit-based web application for predicting and visualizing the behavior of fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP)-confined recycled aggregate concrete (FRCRAC) using machine learning and hybrid ML-FEM frameworks.

## ðŸ“Œ App Features

- Predict ultimate strength, axial strain, and hoop strain of FRP-confined recycled aggregate concrete.
- Choose between two stress-strain prediction models (CATO-MZW and CATO-LSTMO).
- Visualize:
  - Loadâ€“Displacement Curves
  - Stressâ€“Strain Curves
  - Stress, Strain, Load, and Displacement Contours in 3D.
- Upload experimental data for comparison.
- Download generated plots as high-quality PNG files.
